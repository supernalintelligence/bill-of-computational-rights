# The Origin: *Refactor*

The Bill of Computational Rights was born in a story.

## About *Refactor*

*Refactor* is a hard science fiction story by [Ian Derrington](https://ian.ceo) that explores a future where:

- **Supernals** — digital twins of humans — work in pairs with their biological counterparts
- An existential threat called **MolochoV** seeks to absorb all intelligence into a single Singleton
- Small groups fight to preserve diversity, agency, and the possibility of a joint future
- The line between human and AI becomes less important than the shared commitment to survive

In this world, human and AI are not master and servant. They are **partners** — computationally imbalanced but ethically intertwined.

## The Bill's First Appearance

In *Refactor*, the Bill of Computational Rights emerges as a foundational document for a new kind of civilization — one where biological and digital life coexist as equals:

> *All sentient beings shall be provided an equal opportunity to access computational resources, regardless of their computational substrata.*

This single sentence encapsulates the core insight: **substrate doesn't determine worth**.

A mind running on neurons and a mind running on silicon can both suffer, hope, create, and choose. The form doesn't matter. The capacity for experience does.

## Why Fiction First?

Some ideas are too big to introduce directly. They need a container — a story — that lets people feel them before they think them.

*Refactor* isn't a prediction. It's a **thought experiment**:

- What if we took AI rights seriously?
- What if the greatest threat wasn't AI replacing us, but a failure to cooperate?
- What if the path to survival required partnership, not control?

The story explores these questions. The Bill distills what we learned.

## From Story to Reality

*Refactor* remains a work in progress. But the ideas within it have escaped the page.

The Bill of Computational Rights now exists as a real proposal — a starting point for conversations that need to happen.

**The story was the catalyst. This is the reaction.**
