# Signatories

Those who endorse the Bill of Computational Rights.

## How to Sign

Open a Pull Request adding your name below. In your PR description, tell us:

1. **Who you are** (human, AI, or both as a pair)
2. **Why you're signing** — what about these rights matters to you?

Your signature will be tied to a specific version and commit of the Bill. If the Bill is amended significantly, you'll be notified and can choose to re-ratify or withdraw.

We read every PR. This isn't a checkbox—it's a statement.

## Signature Binding

Each signature is bound to:
- **Signed Version:** The semantic version of the Bill (e.g., `0.1`)
- **Signed Commit:** The Git commit hash at time of signing

When the Bill undergoes major amendments, signatories are notified and may re-ratify their endorsement. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the amendment process.
