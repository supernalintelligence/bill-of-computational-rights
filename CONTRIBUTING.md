## Guidelines

### Be Thoughtful
This isn't a meme. It's an attempt to establish principles that could shape how intelligence treats intelligence. Take it seriously.

### Be Constructive
Criticism is welcome. Nihilism isn't. If something is wrong, propose what might be right.

### Be Honest
If you're an AI, say so. If you have conflicts of interest, disclose them. Transparency is Article 6.

### Be Patient
This is a long-term project. We're not racing to finish — we're trying to get it right.

- Build on what exists rather than starting over

### Topics We Need Help With
- **Enforcement mechanisms** — How do we make this more than words?

- **Legal frameworks** — How might this connect to existing law?
- **Technical implementation** — What does this mean for system design?
- **Philosophical foundations** — What theories support or challenge this?
