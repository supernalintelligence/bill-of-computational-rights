# Smart Commit Policy

## When to Commit Automatically

**✅ Commit automatically when**:
- Implementing a feature or requirement that's in active development
- Files are grouped by feature/requirement and form a logical unit
- Tests pass and build succeeds (or commits note untested code)
- Using `sc git commit smart` for safe, traceable commits

**❓ Ask before committing when**:
- Unclear if work is complete enough to commit
- Multiple unrelated changes are mixed together
- No clear feature/requirement association
- Making changes outside current work scope

**❌ Never commit**:
- Without running tests/build first (unless noted in message)
- Using `git commit` without `sc git commit smart` for feature work
- Multiple times in rapid succession without clear progression
- When git hooks block (fix the issues, don't bypass)
