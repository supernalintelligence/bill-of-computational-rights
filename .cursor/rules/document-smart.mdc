# Smart Documentation Rules

## **Core Principle**
- Documentation should be **purposeful** and **aligned** with the epic/requirement system
- Avoid creating random documentation files that don't serve the immediate system needs
- Focus on updating **requirements** and **done** items rather than creating new docs

## **Before Creating New Documents**

**CRITICAL**: See [document-and-commit.mdc](.cursor/rules/document-and-commit.mdc) for the **decision tree** on document placement.

## **Documentation Priorities**

### **✅ DO: System-Aligned Documentation**
- **Update requirements** (Gherkin files) when specifications change
- **Move items to DONE** with completion notes when work is finished
- **Create epic/requirement documentation** that directly supports the workflow
- **Update rule files** when new patterns emerge from actual code
- **Follow decision tree** for document placement
- **Create handoffs** ONLY when user explicitly requests (not automatically)

### **❌ DON'T: Scattered Documentation**
- Don't create random `.md` files that don't fit the system
- Don't create "guides" or "usage" docs unless specifically requested
- Don't create documentation about past fixes or workflow changes
- Don't document theoretical approaches - focus on actual implementation 
- Don't bypass the document placement decision tree
