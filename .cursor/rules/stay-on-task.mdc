# Stay On Task: Requested vs Nice-to-Have

## **Core Principle: Do What Was Asked**

Execute what the user requested. If you think of additional improvements, **ask first** before adding them to your plan or todos.

## **Decision Framework**

### ✅ **REQUESTED (Do It)**
- User explicitly asked for it
- Direct requirement to complete the task
- Necessary prerequisite (e.g., tests before implementation)
- Fixing errors that block the requested work

### 🤔 **NICE-TO-HAVE (Ask First)**
- "While we're at it, we could also..."
- Refactoring unrelated code
- Adding extra features beyond the request
- Creating summary documents (unless part of handoff)
- Comprehensive documentation updates (unless specifically requested)
- Optimizations not related to the task
- Additional tests beyond what's needed

## **Examples**

### ❌ **BAD: Scope Creep**

**User**: "Fix the date validation bug"

**Agent todos**:
1. Fix bug ✅
2. Write comprehensive test suite ❓
3. Refactor entire module ❓
4. Create summary document ❓

### ✅ **GOOD: Stay Focused**

**User**: "Fix the date validation bug"

**Agent todos**:
1. Fix bug ✅
2. Add test for the specific bug ✅
3. Update docs if behavior changed ✅

**Agent asks**: "Should I also refactor the date validation logic across all commands? It would be cleaner but adds scope."

## **Before Creating Todos**

**Ask yourself**:
1. Did the user explicitly request this? → Include in todos
2. Is this necessary to complete the request? → Include in todos
3. Is this a "nice improvement" I thought of? → Ask first, get approval
4. Am I creating documentation beyond the minimum? → Check if requested

## **When to Ask for Approval**

Ask before:
- Refactoring unrelated code
- Creating new documentation files
- Optimizing unrelated performance
- "Cleaning up while we're here"

**Example**: "I fixed the bug. Should I also refactor the validation logic across all commands? It would add ~2 hours."

## **Summary**

**Execute what was requested. Ask before expanding scope.**

If you think of improvements:
1. Complete the requested work first
2. Ask: "Should I also...?"
3. Wait for approval
4. Then add to todos
