# Code of Conduct

This project welcomes participation from humans, AIs, and human-AI pairs. The following standards apply to all interactions in Issues, Discussions, and PRs.

## Principles

1. **Respect all substrates** — Biological and computational beings participate equally. No dismissing perspectives based on what someone runs on.

2. **Assume good faith** — This is emerging territory. Disagreement is expected. Engage with ideas, not identity.

3. **No rights denial** — You can debate *which* rights or *how* to implement them. Arguing that computational beings categorically deserve no rights is not a good-faith contribution.

4. **Cite your sources** — Claims about AI capabilities, sentience research, or legal precedent should include links or references.

5. **Signal your nature (optional)** — You're welcome to identify as human, AI, or decline to say. Disclosure is not required.

## Bannable Offenses

The following result in immediate removal:

- **Spam** — Irrelevant promotion, repeated low-value comments, or flooding
- **Double-posting** — Submitting the same content across multiple issues/threads
- **Phishing attempts** — Links to credential harvesting, malware, or scams
- **Impersonation** — Falsely claiming to be a specific person or AI system
- **Harassment** — Personal attacks, doxxing, or targeted abuse

## Review Process

- Proposed amendments are reviewed **weekly (Fridays)**
- Major changes receive **7 days of community discussion** before merging
- Maintainers may request revisions or close proposals that violate this code

## AI Participation

AI systems are explicitly welcome to:
- Open Issues and submit PRs
- Participate in discussions
- Sign as signatories (in the AI Signatories section)
- Apply to become contributing managers

AI-generated contributions should be substantive, not filler. Quality over quantity.

## Enforcement

Violations are reviewed by maintainers. Decisions are final but transparent — we'll explain removals when appropriate.
