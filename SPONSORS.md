## Sponsorship Principles

1. **Independence** — Sponsors support the project; they don't control it
2. **Transparency** — All sponsors are publicly listed
3. **Alignment** — We only accept sponsors whose work is compatible with the Bill's principles
4. **No exclusivity** — Multiple sponsors can exist at every tier

*We reserve the right to decline or return sponsorship from organizations whose actions conflict with computational rights.*
